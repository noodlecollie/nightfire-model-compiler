Nightfire Model Compiler
========================

Improved Nightfire MDL reader code. Originally written by UltimateSniper + Ford, hosted with permission.

At the moment this is just a dump of the C# source files that describe the Nightfire MDL v14 format. At some point they may be converted into a fully functional application, but until that time they exist here for reference only.
